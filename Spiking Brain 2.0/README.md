## About SpikingBrain2.0

Building on [SpikingBrain1.0](https://github.com/BICLab/SpikingBrain-7B), **SpikingBrain2.0** advances brain-inspired hybrid foundation modeling with two 5B-scale models, **SpB2.0-5B** and **SpB2.0-VL-5B**. Its architecture introduces **Dual-Space Sparse Attention (DSSA)**, an inter-layer hybrid of Sparse Softmax Attention ([MoBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13189)) and Sparse Linear Attention ([SSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16577)), together with **Dual-Path Activation Coding**, which supports both FP8 GPU inference and INT8-Spiking event-driven computation. On the training side, SpikingBrain2.0 develops an optimized **Transformer-to-Hybrid (T2H)** conversion pipeline for LLM and VLM, enabling efficient migration from open-source Transformer backbones. Empirically, SpikingBrain2.0 recovers most of the base Transformer capability while achieving a **10.13× TTFT speedup** at 4M context length, with its spiking computation path further showing potential for low-power neuromorphic deployment.

## Dependency Notes

This repository includes two important local dependency trees.


`flash-linear-attention_dev/` contains a modified version of [flash-linear-attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main) with added support for SSE. In SpikingBrain2.0, SSE is implemented as a sparse state expansion mechanism on top of Gated DeltaNet, enabling improved long-context retrieval with controllable computation and parameter overhead.

---

`MoBA/` contains a customized [MoBA](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA) implementation whose interfaces were adapted to the newer FlashAttention API used by this repository. This bundled `MoBA/` directory is intended for the **Hugging Face side** of the repository. For the **vLLM side**, `spb2_vllm` does **not** use the bundled `MoBA/`. Instead, it depends on the official **`flash-moba`** package.

### Usage

Example scripts are provided in [`run_model/`](run_model) (text generation) and [`run_model_forward/`](run_model_forward) (forward / training step) for running the released checkpoints.

- **Hugging Face**  
  Load the model with `AutoModelForCausalLM` and use it as a standard CausalLM. For text generation, see [`run_model/run_model_hf_base.py`](run_model/run_model_hf_base.py); for a forward pass (loss / logits), see [`run_model_forward/run_model_hf_base.py`](run_model_forward/run_model_hf_base.py). 

  For the SFT model, use the chat template scripts; see [`run_model/run_model_hf_chat.py`](run_model/run_model_hf_chat.py) for generation and [`run_model_forward/run_model_hf_chat.py`](run_model_forward/run_model_hf_chat.py) for a forward pass.  

  For the vision-language model, see [`run_model/run_model_hf_vl.py`](run_model/run_model_hf_vl.py) for generation and [`run_model_forward/run_model_hf_vl.py`](run_model_forward/run_model_hf_vl.py) for a forward pass.

- **vLLM**  
  Run inference with the provided **spb2_vllm** plugin; see [`run_model/run_model_vllm.py`](run_model/run_model_vllm.py) and [`run_model/run_model_vllm_vl.py`](run_model/run_model_vllm_vl.py).  
  Before using vLLM, make sure to remove the `auto_map` field from `config.json`. Specifically, delete the following block if it is present:

```json
"auto_map": {
  "AutoConfig": "configuration_sse_swa_moba.SSESWAMoBAConfig",
  "AutoModelForCausalLM": "modeling_sse_swa_moba.SSESWAMoBAForCausalLM"
}
```

You can also launch a vLLM server directly from the terminal:

```bash
vllm serve <your_model_path> \
  --served-model-name <model_name> \
  --max-model-len 524288 \
  --no-enable-chunked-prefill \
  --no-enable-prefix-caching \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.6 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --block-size 128 \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --port 8000 \
  --compilation-config '{"cudagraph_mode": "FULL_DECODE_ONLY"}'
```

### Performance Evaluation

Table 1: **Performance evaluation of the SpikingBrain2.0-5B-base model.** 
![](assets/table1.png)

SpikingBrain2.0-5B is evaluated using the checkpoint after the LongCT-512k stage, with only **14B tokens** of continued training after conversion. Despite the lightweight training budget, it achieves performance comparable to other strong open-source base models, remains close to **Qwen3-4B** overall.

Table 2: **Performance evaluation of the SpikingBrain2.0-VL-5B model.** 
![](assets/table2.png)

After instruction SFT, SpikingBrain2.0-VL-5B is evaluated on a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks. It delivers competitive performance against strong open-source baselines such as **Qwen2.5-VL-3B** and **LLaVA-OneVision-7B**, while largely recovering the multimodal capability of the base **Qwen3-VL-4B**.
